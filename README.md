# µPlaits SE (uPlaits, microPlaits) Eurorack [Rev C]

## 8HP Eurorack module | Macro-oscillator

[µPlaits SE](http://uplaits-se.com) is a voltage-controlled sound source offering direct access to a large palette of easily tweakable raw sonic material generated by models spanning a wide range of synthesis techniques.

This re-engineered Eurorack module miniaturizes and redesigns the original [Mutable Instruments Plaits](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/plaits/), reducing its size from 12HP to 8HP and reworking its front panel layout.

Fully compatible with upstream Plaits firmware. Includes power cable, mounting hardware, and a one-year warranty. Designed and built with care by [Tall Dog Electronics](http://tall-dog.com) in Western Massachusetts. Licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) open source hardware.
